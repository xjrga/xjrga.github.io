Writing Model to File
---------------------

.. figure:: ../images/writetofile.png
   :alt: write model to file
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/writetofile.png

   A model file will be written to file every time a Snack finds a solution and you can find it in the models directory

The Linear Program Model
------------------------

.. figure:: ../images/14.png
   :alt: linear program model
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/14.png

   This is the linear program output generated by Snack that you can run on any lp solver software.

LPSOLVE LP format example
-------------------------

An Example File

*  `Chicken, Rice and Veggies model file for lpsolve <../../../files/other/snack_lpsolve_1743971125.lp>`_

For example, user could use the following command to solve problem in linux

* lp_solve -piv1 -s1 -S3 chicken_rice_and_veggies.lp

The Solution File

*  `Chicken, Rice and Veggies model solution <../../../files/other/snack_lpsolve_1743971125.lp.sol>`_

On windows, user can use lpsolve for windows

.. figure:: ../images/lpsolve_01.png
   :alt: Solving Problem on a Different Solver
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/lpsolve_01.png

   The chicken, rice and veggies mix problem on lpsolve for windows

.. figure:: ../images/lpsolve_02.png
   :alt: Solving Problem on a Different Solver
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/lpsolve_02.png

   The result of the chicken, rice and veggies mix problem using lpsolve for windows

* `https://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve <https://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve>`_
