Important points on HGI vs LGI
==============================
* Glycemic index is a measure that reflects a carbohydrate's ability to raise blood glucose levels. It compares the effect of 50 grams of carbohydrate in different foods on our blood glucose against the effect of 50 grams of pure glucose. There is a blood glucose level peak at about 30 to 45 minutes and then it falls to baseline within two or three hours.
    * Glycemic Index Scale
    * High (70 or more)
    * Medium (56 to 69)
    * Low (55 or less)
* It is more effective to consume HGI carbs for a few hours after exercise and then consume LGI meals for remainder of recovery period (especially important for athletes). Glycemic index is important to take into account when designing diets to deliver glucose rapidly to working muscle or to optimise fat metabolism
* LGI carbohydrate results in a higher rate of fat oxidation than after a HGI carbohydrate meal due to a lower insulin level. Low insulin is the primary signal for fatty acid mobilization. Athletes also reported less hunger on LGI diet.
* Most important factors for glycogen re-synthesis
    * Amount of carbohydrate ingested
    * Frequency of ingestion
    * Type of carbohydrate (HGI vs LGI)
* The amount of carbohydrate in meals has much greater influence on glycemia than source or type of carbohydrate
* There is an active promotion of carbohydrate foods with a low glycemic index in the nutritional management of diabetes.
* Factors that affect glycemic response to foods are:
    * Amount of carbohydrate
    * Composition of carbohydrate (content of sugars, resistant starch, etc)
    * Effects of cooking or processing
* HGI carbohydrate meals may shorten sleep onset.
