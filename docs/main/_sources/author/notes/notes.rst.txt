Personal Notes
--------------

Author's original problem was overnutrition, an intake of calories that exceeded his expenditure, so over time, he became overweight and that brought complications like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high triglycerides and low energy that in the long term could have led to cardiovascular disease. To solve the problem before it got out of hand, he had to lower his calorie intake, increase his expenditure, follow suggestions from health organizations, get the necessary essential nutrients from nutrient-dense food and wait for slowly appearing results. It is a process that takes years in either direction it goes.

Nutrition Activities and Objectives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Health is the goal
* Slimming down even a little will accrue health benefits
* Slowly work yourself up to your long-term goal
* There is a minimum amount of exercise that is recommended
* If acid reflux is a problem, make last meal of the day small and avoid acidic foods
* Get the essential nutrients, vitamins, minerals and essential fatty acids
* Get the required fiber
* Keep an eye on the salt and saturated fats
* Drink a glass of water before every meal to keep you hydrated
* Author uses Snack to make sure he is within budget (calories) and to make sure he get the essential nutrients
* Author eats from a limited menu most of the time
* Author eats six equally sized meals per day from 5am to 8pm, a meal every 3 hrs.
* When hunger temporarily occurs, author ignores it until next meal
* Always warm-up well before exercising to minimize injuries and avoid jerky movements

Solution Testing Process
------------------------
* Get a solution from Snack (food items and quantities)
* Try it out for a day, week or month or longer. It is important to find out how individual's body reacts to the new food and that takes time.
* If solution works, keep, if not, make adjustments, recalculate, get a new one and retest. Change food items, change quantities or both.
* Change one thing at a time and make small changes

Tracking progress
-----------------
* Check body weight
* Check body fat (Author does a quick pinch check, tries his pants on, looks at the mirror and also checks his body fat percentage on the tanita weight scale. User decides what weight and body fat is appropriate for him or her. There is a body fat percentage range that is considered healthy by the medical doctors and nutrition experts.)
* Check body strength
* Check vital signs (body temperature, pulse rate. respiration rate, blood pressure)
* Have blood lab work done every year at least to track changes
* Pay attention to daily energy level
* Pay attention to digestive system changes
* Pay attention to mood changes
* Pay attention to mental performance

Energy intake - calorie budget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* A good starting ball park figure for the energy intake is the number obtained from one of the basal metabolic rate equations
* Individual can increase or decrease the initial ball park figure calories according to how he/she feels and the results obtained
* There is a calorie intake sweet spot that allows individual to feel comfortable and slim down at the same time
* It is a lifelong journey. It is something individual needs to do everyday of his/her life so setting a good pace is critical so that he/she does not burn out. Individual should go as fast as he/she can tolerate. Individual does not have to go at the same pace always. When he/she is in the mood, accelerate, if not, take it slow.
* If trying to slim down, calorie deficit should be small for highest probability of success
* The smaller the deficit, the longer it will take but a large deficit will make you weak, ravenous, will impair your workouts and may cause sleeping problems
* There may be a point in time when a deficit is no longer needed
* Negative emotions and hypoglycemia will wreck individual's calorie budget plan
* An increase in activity level may trigger a hunger response
* A lower glycemic index diet may cause less hunger
* To keep daily calories equal, keep protein intake steady and exchange carbohydrates for fat and vice versa
* Distribute your carbohydrates and protein evenly through out the day except after exercise when you may have to eat a little extra

Energy expenditure - exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Walking is easy, low risk and very effective
* Strength training and cardio will get best results
