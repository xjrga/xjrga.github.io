<h2>Personal Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#personal-notes" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Author’s original problem was overnutrition, an intake of calories that exceeded his expenditure, so over time, he became overweight and that brought complications like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high triglycerides and low energy that in the long term could have led to cardiovascular disease. To solve the problem before it got out of hand, he had to lower his calorie intake, increase his expenditure, follow suggestions from health organizations, get the necessary essential nutrients from nutrient-dense food and wait for slowly appearing results. It is a process that takes years in either direction it goes.</p>

<section id="energy-intake-calorie-budget">
<h3>Energy intake - calorie budget<a class="headerlink" href="#energy-intake-calorie-budget" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A good starting ball park figure for the energy intake is the number obtained from one of the basal metabolic rate equations</p></li>
<li><p>Individual can increase or decrease the initial ball park figure calories according to how he/she feels and the results obtained</p></li>
<li><p>There is a calorie intake sweet spot that allows individual to feel comfortable and slim down at the same time</p></li>
<li><p>It is a lifelong journey. It is something individual needs to do everyday of his/her life so setting a good pace is critical so that he/she does not burn out. Individual should go as fast as he/she can tolerate. Individual does not have to go at the same pace always. When he/she is in the mood, accelerate, if not, take it slow.</p></li>
<li><p>If trying to slim down, calorie deficit should be small for highest probability of success</p></li>
<li><p>The smaller the deficit, the longer it will take but a large deficit will make you weak, ravenous, will impair your workouts and may cause sleeping problems</p></li>
<li><p>There may be a point in time when a deficit is no longer needed</p></li>
<li><p>Negative emotions and hypoglycemia will wreck individual’s calorie budget plan</p></li>
<li><p>An increase in activity level may trigger a hunger response</p></li>
<li><p>A lower glycemic index diet may cause less hunger</p></li>
<li><p>To keep daily calories equal, keep protein intake steady and exchange carbohydrates for fat and vice versa</p></li>
<li><p>Distribute your carbohydrates and protein evenly through out the day except after exercise when you may have to eat a little extra</p></li>
