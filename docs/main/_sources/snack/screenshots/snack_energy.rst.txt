   This is the calories summary view

* Control-h maximizes upper panel
* Control-l maximizes bottom panel
* Control-m sets upper and bottom panel in normal position
* Pressing Delete on 'Calories' list clears it
* Solve model often to see latest results
* If a user modifies the model, tries to solve for it and now Snack throws an unfeasible message, user can Undo changes and go back to last working model. If user solves model then Undo does not apply
