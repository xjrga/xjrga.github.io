Glycemic index is the area under the 2-h blood glucose response curve (AUCs) for each food expressed as a percentage of the area after taking the same amount of carbohydrate as glucose. It reflects a food's ability to raise blood glucose levels.

Glycemic load is the amount of glucose that will be cleared from the blood within a 2-h period. The formula is digestiblecarbohydrate (g) * glycemic index (gi). It is correlated with the glucose utilization rate in a normal individual.

Meal glycemic index reflects a meal's ability to raise the blood glucose level. It is a weighted average of the glycemic index of the foods where the weight is the percent of carbohydrate contributed by the food item.

Food quotient is the ratio CO2 molecules discharged from the body per number of O2 molecules consumed when a specific food item is oxidized by the body. It is measure of the nutrient composition of the food item or diet, "the fuel mix".

Complete protein is a protein whose amino acids occur in the right proportion to support growth or maintenance. It provides all essential amino acids.

Fiber is carbohydrate that can not be digested.

Total Nutrient Index is a useful construct to assess total micronutrient exposures of underconsumed micronutrients among US adults. It includes 8 underconsumed micronutrients identified by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans: calcium; magnesium; potassium; choline; and vitamins A, C, D, and E and it is expressed as a percentage of the RDA or Adequate Intake.
